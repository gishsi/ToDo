# ToDo
## General Info
This is a simple app that I have build while exploring the MERN stack.

## Technologies
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- MongoDB Atlas
- mongoose
- ReactJS
- axios

## Setup
To run the project first go into the **server** directory 
```
cd server
```
and run:
```
npm install -g
```
This will install all the required dependencies.
Now make a .env file with the TODO_DB variable set to your MongoDB atlas database URL.
Next, run:
```
node ./server.js
```
By doing this, the back-end of this app will be run on your localhost.




Next, go back to the root directory,

```
cd ..
```
and then change into the **client** directory
```
cd client
```
and run:
```
npm install -g
```
This will install all the required dependencies.
Next, run:
```
npm start
```
This will start the front-end of this application.
